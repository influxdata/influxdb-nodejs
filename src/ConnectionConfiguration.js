/**
 * A ConnectionConfiguration must be provided when calling {@link Connection.create}
 * so that you can start writing data into InfluxDB.
 *
 * @typedef {Object} ConnectionConfiguration
 * @property {String} [username='root'] Username for connecting to the database.
 * @property {String} [password='root'] Password for connecting to the database.
 * @property {String} [database] Database to work with
 * @property {Boolean} [autoCreateDatabase=true] Automatically create database if it doesn't exist
 *      yet. To successfully connect to InfluxDB with autoCreateDatabase=true the database user
 *      authentication must be turned off or you must have admin privileges granted
 * @property {String} [hostUrl='http://127.0.0.1:8086'] InfluxDB host url to connect to. For
 *      InfluxCloud use https scheme and don't forget to pass username and password properties.
 *      For UDP access use a URL in the following form: udp://127.0.0.1:8089. For more information
 *      on using the UDP InfluxDB service check the
 *      documentation https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb/blob/master/services/udp/README.md
 * @property {Schema[]} [schema] schema of measurements accessed by this connection, validated when
 *      writing data points into InfluxDB. See {@link Schema} for more information.
 * @property {Boolean} [autoGenerateTimestamps=true] When writing data points without a timestamp:
 *   * If set to true the timestamp will be filled in automatically when {@link Connection.write}
 *     method is called
 *   * If false the timestamp will be filled in by the InfluxDB server
 * @property {Number} [batchSize=1000] Number of data points in a batch.
 *    Data points written into the InfluxDBConnection are
 *    buffered in the connection until the batch size is
 *    reached or maximumWriteDelay is reached (see below.)
 *    To learn more about batching see {@link Connection.write}.
 * @property {Number} [maximumWriteDelay=1000] Maximum number of milliseconds
 *    the data point can be buffered in the InfluxDBConnection.
 *    When this limit is reached for a single data point written, any older data points are also
 *    written into InfluxDB. To learn more about batching see {@link Connection.write}.
 * @property {Boolean} [autoResolveBufferedWritePromises=true] if true the {@link Promise} returned
 * by {@link Connection.write} will be automatically resolved when the data are put into the buffer.
 *  This is useful for larger batch sizes for performance reasons and to avoid pollution of log
 *  files (there will be just one error generated for the whole batch on the last accepted
 *  {@link Connection.write} invocation). If false the {@link Promise} returned by
 *  {@link Connection.write} will always get rejected or resolved when the data points are written
 *  into InfluxDB. See more at {@link Connection.write}.
 * @property {function} [batchWriteErrorHandler] handler called when batch write to InfluxDB fails
 *  and the autoResolveBufferedWritePromises configuration property is set to true. This is useful
 *  in the case when the batch write gets triggered due to maximumWriteDelay expiration. See
 *  the example below:
 *
 *  To learn more about batching see {@link Connection.write}.
 *
 * @example
 * const InfluxDB = require('influx-nodejs')
 *
 * // Connect to a single host with a full set of config details and
 * // a custom schema
 * const connection = new InfluxDB.Connection({
 *   database: 'my_db',
 *   username: 'influxUser33',
 *   password: 'awesomeflux!',
 *   hostUrl: 'http://db1.example.com:8086' },
 *   schema: [{
 *     measurement: 'serverLoad',
 *     tags: ['hostname'],
 *     fields: {
 *       memory_usage: InfluxDB.FieldType.INTEGER,
 *       cpu_usage: InfluxDB.FieldType.FLOAT,
 *       is_online: InfluxDB.FieldType.BOOLEAN,
 *     }
 *   }],
 *   batchWriteErrorHandler(e, dataPoints) { // this is the same as the default value
 *     console.log('[DefaultBatchWriteErrorHandler] Error writing data points into InfluxDB:' +
 *       dataPoints,e);
 *   }
 * })
